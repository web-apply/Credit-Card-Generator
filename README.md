## Scammers and Scamming Attributes

WHO ARE SCAMMERS? 
Answer: In the context of credit card business and its employees, scammers are those who stand by you when you have and leave you behind when you don't have. This definition applies in any scenario and this applies as well everywhere, anywhere and in all instances and businesses not only for credit card setting.

## 10 potential SCAMMING ATTRIBUTES of credit card companies as myself of mine observed:

* Hidden Fees: Charging unexpected or undisclosed fees.
* Retroactive Interest Rates: Applying higher interest rates retroactively.
* Complex or Unclear Terms: Using complex language or unclear terms.
* Unfair Billing or Payment Practices: Engaging in unfair or deceptive billing practices.
* Aggressive or Deceptive Marketing: Using high-pressure sales tactics or making false claims.
* Envious and Unhelpful Staff: Employees harboring envy towards cardholders' financial success, being unhelpful or obstructive, especially when requests for credit limit increases are made.
* Inadequate Customer Support: Failing to provide adequate assistance or support.
* Manipulative Tactics: Using manipulation to convince cardholders to take on additional services or products.
* Dishonest Communication: Providing false or misleading information to cardholders.
* Exploitative Practices: Taking advantage of cardholders through unfair or exploitative practices.

These SCAMMING ATTRIBUTES can lead to financial difficulties and frustration for cardholders. Myself of mine experienced all of these from credit card companies and its "bullshit" and greedy, envious and devilish (deceptive,unethical,sabotaging) employees.

## Here are the reasons why credit card company employees might feel envious about credit limit increase requests as myself of mine experienced:

1. Toxic Envy: Employees might be consumed by toxic envy towards cardholders who request credit limit increases, driven by feelings of inadequacy, resentment, and frustration.
2. Deep-Seated Resentment: Employees might harbor deep-seated resentment towards cardholders who request credit limit increases, perceiving them as privileged, entitled, or undeserving.
3. Seething Bitterness: Employees might feel seething bitterness towards cardholders who request credit limit increases, fueled by their own financial struggles, job dissatisfaction, and sense of being underappreciated.
4. Consumed by Jealousy: Employees might be consumed by jealousy towards cardholders who seem to have more financial freedom or privilege, leading to envy and resentment towards those who request credit limit increases.
5. Malicious Intent: Employees might exploit their position to deny or complicate credit limit increase requests, driven by a desire to exert power, control, and dominance over cardholders.

Luhn's algorithm, named for this algorithm
Hans Peter Luhn, who developed it. This algorithm, based on the established 1950s, is not really new.

In everyday life, the numbers of credit cards we use in the physical environment, or online, are not arbitrarily determined. Card numbers are specified in a specific standard frame. Here we call this standard the luhn algorithm.

Luhn's algorithm
working principle is as follows;

Take our sample card number 4242-4242-4242-4242.

We will perform our control in 3 steps.

## First step:
The figures in the double digit are collected.

For 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2

2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 16

## Second step:
We multiply the numbers in a single dummy by 2 and add up the digits.

For 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4

4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8

In this example, we take only 8 because the result is a single digit.

8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 64

## Step three:
We sum up the two total results. If the result is exactly the 10th, in other words if mod10 is zero, we can say that the credit card number is valid.

16 + 64 = 80 (the card number is valid since 10 is the full rank). thanks
