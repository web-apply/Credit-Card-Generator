## AVOID, AVOID AND AVOID THESE CREDIT CARD COMPANIES FOR YOUR LIFE TO BE PEACEFUL

While their other products seem doing good in the philippine market, their credit card products are worst in all areas and they are starters of scamming activities towards their consumers.

Here are the following philippine-issued and philippine-based credit cards that apparently have scamming attributes and for the sake of others, please avoid these card companies:

* Metrobank
* Eastwest
* RCBC
* BPI
* PNB
* Citibank
* Unionbank
  
These listed credit card companies and its employees are good candidates for cremation death penalty alive version. They deserve to die or get burned alive as their punishment. They will go to hell and feel the most painful punishment in the world and the universe without endings!! üò°üò°üò°. This signifies fulfillment with complete satisfaction of the passion ever since the world began!!. 

## Scammers and Scamming Attributes

WHO ARE SCAMMERS? 
* Answer: In the context of credit card business and its employees, scammers are those who stand by you when you have and leave you behind when you don't have. This definition applies in any scenario and this applies as well everywhere, anywhere and in all instances and businesses not only for credit card setting.

## 15 potential SCAMMING ATTRIBUTES of credit card companies as myself of mine observed:

* Hidden Fees: Charging unexpected or undisclosed fees.
* Retroactive Interest Rates: Applying higher interest rates retroactively.
* Complex or Unclear Terms: Using complex language or unclear terms.
* Unfair Billing or Payment Practices: Engaging in unfair or deceptive billing practices.
* Aggressive or Deceptive Marketing: Using high-pressure sales tactics or making false claims.
* Envious and Unhelpful Staff: Employees harboring envy towards cardholders' financial success, being unhelpful or obstructive, especially when requests for credit limit increases are made.
* Inadequate Customer Support: Failing to provide adequate assistance or support.
* Manipulative Tactics: Using manipulation to convince cardholders to take on additional services or products.
* Dishonest Communication: Providing false or misleading information to cardholders.
* Exploitative Practices: Taking advantage of cardholders through unfair or exploitative practices.
* Interest Rate Changes without Notice: Changing interest rates without properly notifying the cardholder, leading to unexpected increases in interest charges.
* Unfair Credit Limit Decrease: Reducing a cardholder's credit limit without justification, leading to increased utilization ratios and potential negative impacts on credit scores.
* Inadequate Disclosure of Foreign Transaction Fees: Failing to clearly disclose foreign transaction fees, leading to unexpected charges on international transactions.
* Unfair Balance Transfer Terms: Making it difficult for cardholders to take advantage of balance transfer offers, such as charging fees or applying interest rates that negate the benefits of the transfer.
* Aggressive Upselling: Aggressively marketing additional products or services to cardholders, such as credit protection or identity theft services, without clearly disclosing the terms or costs.
* Unfair Debt Collection Practices: Engaging in aggressive or abusive debt collection practices, such as making excessive phone calls, threatening legal action, or contacting cardholders at inconvenient times.
* Credit Score Manipulation: Manipulating credit scores or reporting information to credit bureaus in a way that is inaccurate or unfair, potentially harming cardholders' creditworthiness.
* Exploiting Vulnerable Cardholders: Targeting vulnerable cardholders, such as those with poor credit or financial difficulties, with predatory products or services that take advantage of their situation.
* Inadequate Dispute Resolution: Failing to properly investigate and resolve disputes or errors, such as unauthorized transactions or billing mistakes, in a timely and fair manner.

These scamming attributes highlight other potential ways in which credit card companies might engage in unfair or deceptive practices, taking advantage of cardholders through lack of transparency, unauthorized actions, or biased terms.

These SCAMMING ATTRIBUTES can lead to financial difficulties and frustration for cardholders. Myself of mine experienced all of these from credit card companies and its "bullshit" and greedy, envious and devilish (deceptive, unethical, sabotaging) employees.

## Here are the reasons why credit card company employees might feel envious about credit limit increase requests as myself of mine experienced:

1. Toxic Envy: Employees might be consumed by toxic envy towards cardholders who request credit limit increases, driven by feelings of inadequacy, resentment, and frustration.
2. Deep-Seated Resentment: Employees might harbor deep-seated resentment towards cardholders who request credit limit increases, perceiving them as privileged, entitled, or undeserving.
3. Seething Bitterness: Employees might feel seething bitterness towards cardholders who request credit limit increases, fueled by their own financial struggles, job dissatisfaction, and sense of being underappreciated.
4. Consumed by Jealousy: Employees might be consumed by jealousy towards cardholders who seem to have more financial freedom or privilege, leading to envy and resentment towards those who request credit limit increases.
5. Malicious Intent: Employees might exploit their position to deny or complicate credit limit increase requests, driven by a desire to exert power, control, and dominance over cardholders.
7. Invidious Comparison to Cardholders' Spending Habits: Employees might feel envious of cardholders' seemingly carefree spending habits, particularly if they feel constrained by their own financial circumstances.
8. Sense of Being Underpaid to Deal with Demanding Cardholders: Employees might feel underpaid or undervalued for dealing with demanding cardholders who request credit limit increases, leading to resentment towards these cardholders.
9. Luxury Purchases: Employees might envy cardholders who use their credit cards to make luxury purchases or enjoy high-end experiences, feeling that they can't afford such indulgences themselves.
10. High Credit Limits: Employees might envy cardholders who have high credit limits, feeling that they themselves are limited by their own creditworthiness or financial situation.
11. Perceived Status Symbol: Employees might view credit cards with high limits or exclusive benefits as a status symbol, and feel envious of cardholders who possess these cards.
12. High Rewards Earnings: Employees might envy cardholders who earn high rewards rates or bonuses, feeling that they themselves don't have access to similar earning potential.
13. Special Treatment: Employees might envy cardholders who receive special treatment or personalized service from their credit card company, feeling that they themselves are treated like any other customer.
14. Access to Premium Card Benefits: Employees might envy cardholders who have access to premium card benefits, such as travel insurance, concierge services, or exclusive events, feeling that they themselves don't have access to similar perks.
15. Flexibility in Payment Terms: Employees might envy cardholders who are able to negotiate flexible payment terms or temporary hardship programs, feeling that they themselves are stuck with rigid payment schedules.
16. High Credit Score Benefits: Employees might envy cardholders who have high credit scores and are able to qualify for better loan terms, lower interest rates, or other financial benefits, feeling that they themselves are limited by their own credit score.

These reasons highlight the potential envy factor that might drive feelings of resentment or frustration among credit card employees towards cardholders who request credit limit increases.

Luhn's algorithm, named for this algorithm
Hans Peter Luhn, who developed it. This algorithm, based on the established 1950s, is not really new.

In everyday life, the numbers of credit cards we use in the physical environment, or online, are not arbitrarily determined. Card numbers are specified in a specific standard frame. Here we call this standard the luhn algorithm.

Luhn's algorithm
working principle is as follows;

Take our sample card number 4242-4242-4242-4242.

We will perform our control in 3 steps.

## First step:
The figures in the double digit are collected.

For 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2

2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 16

## Second step:
We multiply the numbers in a single dummy by 2 and add up the digits.

For 4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4

4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8
4 x 2 = 8 & gt; 8

In this example, we take only 8 because the result is a single digit.

8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 64

## Step three:
We sum up the two total results. If the result is exactly the 10th, in other words if mod10 is zero, we can say that the credit card number is valid.

16 + 64 = 80 (the card number is valid since 10 is the full rank). thanks
